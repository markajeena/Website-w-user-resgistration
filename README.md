Phase 1: 
A simple User Registration that asks for username, password1, confirm password, firstname, lastname, and email. 
No duplicates usernames and emails, passwords must match. Once Logged in you should be welcomed in a logged in page.

Phase 2:
Initialize DB button that creates or recreates the database. Create an ER Diagram that shows how many tables there will be for the rest of the Project, one is not good
enough. Create a GUI system where the user can create a blog with following attributes such as Subject, Description and Tags, ids of the blog should be automatically
created using increments. Select a blog from the list and can create a comment, at most can comment 3 times a day, one comment for each blog not his own.

Phase 3: TBA
